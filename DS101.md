## Data Science Lifecycle

Data science is a rapidly evolving field that can uncover insights about user behavior and world trends through the analysis of massive datasets. The seven steps that make up a data science lifecycle are: 
* business understanding
* data mining
* data cleaning
* data exploration
* feature engineering
* predictive modeling
* data visualization.

### 1. Business Understanding
Before starting a data science project, it is critical to understand the problem that needs to be solved and the central objectives of the project.
There are five types of questions that data science is typically used to answer: 
* How much or how many? (regression)
* Which category? (classification)
* Which group? (clustering)
* Is this weird? (anomaly detection)
* Which option should be taken? (recommendation)

### 2. Data Mining
Data mining is the process of gathering data from different sources. Define what data you need for the project and where it is located. If the data is in a database, use SQL or Pandas to manipulate it. If the data doesn't exist in a dataset, use web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup. For mobile apps, there are tools like Google Analytics that track user engagement and interactions.

### 3. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of preparing and cleaning the gathered data for analysis. It is the most time-consuming process, taking 50-80% of a data scientist's time. Data cleaning is necessary due to inconsistencies in data, such as misspellings or inconsistent data types. One important aspect of data cleaning is handling missing data, which can cause errors in model creation and training. One approach to handling missing data is average imputation, but it may not always be recommended.

### 4. Data Exploration
The data exploration stage involves understanding the patterns and biases in the clean data through different techniques such as analyzing a random subset of the data, plotting histograms and distribution curves, and creating interactive visualizations. Hypotheses about the data and problem can then be formed based on this information. Examples of visualizations include visualizing the relationship between student scores and sleep or plotting real estate prices as a heat map on a spatial plot.

### 5. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into informative features that represent the business problem being solved. This stage directly influences the accuracy of the predictive model. There are two types of tasks in feature engineering - 
* feature selection
* construction
Feature selection involves cutting down features that add more noise than information, while feature construction involves creating new features from the existing ones.

An example of when you might want to do this is when you have a continuous variable, but your domain knowledge informs you that you only really need an indicator variable based on a known threshold. For example, if you have a feature for age, but your model only cares about if a person is an adult or minor, you could threshold it at 18, and assign different categories to instances above and below that threshold. You could also merge multiple features to make them more informative by taking their sum, difference or product. For example, if you were predicting student scores and had features for the number of hours of sleep on each night, you might want to create a feature that denoted the average sleep that the student had instead.

### 6. Predictive Modeling
Predictive modeling is the stage where machine learning is used in a data science project. Choose the model based on the questions asked in the business understanding stage and the data available. Different cheat sheets are available online to help pick the right algorithm based on the classification or regression problem. Evaluate the success of the trained model using k-fold cross validation. For classification models, accuracy is tested using PCC and confusion matrix, while for regression models, common metrics include coefficient of determination, mean squared error, and average absolute error.

### 7. Data Visualization
Data visualization is a combination of communication, psychology, statistics, and art to communicate data in a simple, effective, and visually pleasing way. The goal is to represent insights from the model in a way that key stakeholders in the project can understand. Python notebooks like Jupyter with libraries like Seaborn and Bokeh can allow for rapid iteration in the analysis and visualization pipeline. Tools like Tableau and Plotly allow for easy manipulation of data for more complex visualizations. D3.js is a good starting point for building interactive visualizations for the web.

### 8. Business Understanding
Now that we’ve gone through the entire lifecycle, it’s time to go back to the business understanding stage, where we evaluate how the success of our model relates to our original business goals. We need to ask ourself whether the model solved the problems that were identified in the initial stages, and whether the analysis yielded any tangible solutions. This stage is iterative, so any new insights discovered during the first iteration of the lifecycle can be used to generate more powerful insights in the next iteration.
